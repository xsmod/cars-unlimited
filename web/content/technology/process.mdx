## Multi-Environment Pipeline

Cars Unlimited uses a four-stage CI/CD pipeline across dev, staging, and production environments.

**Stage 1: Development** - Pushes to `dev` branch trigger builds and tests, deploying to the dev slot for immediate feedback.

**Stage 2: Staging** - Pull requests targeting `main` deploy to the staging slot for validation before merge approval.

**Stage 3: Production (Main)** - Merges to `main` build and test code, deploying to the main production slot.

**Stage 4: Blue-Green Swap** - GitHub releases trigger a zero-downtime slot swap, instantly promoting tested code to production with rollback capability.
