Our client, Cars Unlimited has a site that they are looking to migrate to Azure from on-premises as part of their digital transformation project. However, they require their warehouse inventory and shipping data to remain on-premises due to the age of the systems in place.

As part of this transformation, they have outlined that one of their key goals is to move from deploying 3 times a month, out of hours to deploying to production up to 5 times per day with three 9s of availability in production.

They have engaged us to help to design a new solution for the current on-premises hosted web application and infrastructure design.

The below diagram was produced:

We are now at the point where we need to begin considering implementation and how this will be automated. The client has stipulated there should be no manual steps required to go from commit to in production.

<h2>The Task</h2>

Define a continuous integration and continuous delivery strategy for the client to help them achieve their goal of 5 deployments to production per day, safely and securely. This should cover both the application and the infrastructure.

Ensure you outline what tooling you would recommend and why you would use it.

Be sure to include an estimate of how long you believe it would take to implement such a strategy, how many engineers it would require, questions you would need to ask the client, any pre-requisites, how you would lead the technical delivery of the project and how you would ensure the solution is delivered to a high standard.
